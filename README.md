# Electric Induction of a Biologic System

This project was carried out as part of the third year Application Working Group course at the [Universty of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/).

This project, supervised by Mr Sergio Corridore, focuses on the characterization of the impedance of a cell layer located in muscle tissue, the myoblasts.

## Presentation of the project
### Objectives
The goal is to manage to model a cell layer. At our disposal we have the data from an experiment.
